    Dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, <br />
    dogs have been bred for herding livestock (collies, sheepdogs), hunting (hounds, pointers) and rodent control <br />
    (terriers). Other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs, detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugs <br />
    or chemical weapons; guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs that pull loads. In 1957, <br />
    the dog Laika became the first animal to be launched into Earth orbit, aboard the Soviets' Sputnik 2; <br />she died during the flight.
    Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs and <br />
    psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities. Some dogs owned by people with epilepsy have been shown <br />
    to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, <br />
    allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.
